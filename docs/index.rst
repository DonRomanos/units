Welcome to mp-units!
====================

**mp-units** is a compile-time enabled Modern C++ library that provides compile-time dimensional
analysis and unit/quantity manipulation. Source code is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/mpusz/units>`_
with a permissive `MIT license <https://github.com/mpusz/units/blob/master/LICENSE.md>`_.


.. important::

    The **mp-units** library is the subject of this ISO C++ paper: `P1935 <https://wg21.link/p1935>`_.
    It is explained in this `CppCon 2019 talk <https://youtu.be/0YW6yxkdhlU>`_ (slightly dated now).
    We are working towards potentially having it standardized for C++23 and are actively looking
    for parties interested in field trialing the library.

.. note::

    As this library targets C++23 and extensively uses C++20 features as of now it compiles correctly
    only with gcc-9.1 and newer.
